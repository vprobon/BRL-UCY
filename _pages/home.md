We are a small -- yet interdisciplinary -- group at the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/biol) at the [University of Cyprus](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/). Our research in computational biology and bioinformatics is mainly oriented towards the interpretation of large scale genomic and biological data in order to reveal the principles governing the molecular basis of life. Along these lines, we develop/utilize computational methods (empirical, statistical and machine/deep learning) that exploit any available type of biological information (e.g. macromolecular sequences and structures, gene expression data, biomedical literature) towards understanding biological systems, ranging from macromolecules and macromolecular complexes, to phenotypes.

We are a dynamic research group at the [Leiden Institute of Physics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl). Our aim is to explore and understand [quantum materials](http://condensedconcepts.blogspot.nl/2013/05/what-is-quantum-matter.html), including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter.

We are mostly interested in problems related to protein sequence-structure-function and we have are recent interest in the interface of computational genomics and synthetic (micro)biology.

In particular, we have a long-standing interest in the study of classes of non-globular proteins (e.g. transmembrane proteins, protein sequences with local compositional biases or repeats). During the last decade we have focused our research on protein components of eukaryotic endomembrane systems, in particular nuclear pore complex subunits and components of the autophagy machinery. 

More specifically, we devise algorithms, methods/tools, databases and computer systems for:

1. Protein sequence analysis and structural bioinformatics, e.g. repeats, low complexity/compositional bias, intrinsic structural disorder, (trans)membrane proteins.
2. Computational comparative genomics, e.g. evolution of low complexity/compositionally biased sequences, computational approaches for synthetic biology (recently with wet-lab expansion).
3. Biomedical text mining and its applications in biocuration (with a focus in selective autophagy)

To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)).

We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from [Quantum Matter & Optics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/qo-home), as well as with the colleagues from our [world-class theory section](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl).

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
